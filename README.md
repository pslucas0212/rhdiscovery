# Using Red Hat's Discovery Tool to assist with Red Hat software inventory management

Discovery ...

This tutorial demonstrates the installation and use of Discovery in a small vMare based environment.  My lab configurtion consists of three x86 8-core 64GB RAM machines formally used for gaming purposes. I'm using VMWare vSphere Essentials 6.7 for this simple lab environment. The lab is running on its own subnet with local DNS and DHCP services.
